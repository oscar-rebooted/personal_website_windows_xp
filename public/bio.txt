Ahoy there!

Nice to meet you, I'm Oscar.

I'm currently an AI Engineer at BCG in London.

For my undergrad I studied a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Oxford.

I'm currently curious about signals analysis, embedded systems, and distributed processing.

In my personal time, you can find me practicing my Portuguese, playing tennis, or learning about Chinese dynasties (currently looking at Emperor Taizong - he's Tang-tastic!).
